# Guess the Number game

It is a simple number-guessing game, where the users are required to guess a number in the range 1 - 15.
And the program guides them to make the correct guess by showing them alerts. It will tell users if each guess is too high or too low.

This is a good game to code because it uses random numbers, loops, and input from the users, and also demonstrate how to use 'if' statements in practice to display different results to the user depending on the inputs.
